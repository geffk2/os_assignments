The results here seem worse than in ex3 across the board.
We can notice that a lot more time is spend in kernel mode than in ex3.
I think that is because threads sleep a lot while waiting for the next number:
Checking a given number is fast, but waiting for 100 other processes to lock-unlock a mutex is much slower.
